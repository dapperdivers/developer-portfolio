- ✅ Story creation for molecules (ExperienceCard, ProjectsCard, Navigation, etc.)
- ✅ Story creation for organisms (Skills, Experience, Education, etc.)
- ✅ Story creation for templates (Section, App)
- ✅ Story interaction tests with play functions
- ✅ Accessibility testing integration
- ✅ Responsive viewport testing
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Testing & Documentation
- ✅ Testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library
- ✅ Unit tests for key components (Button, Card, Section)
- ✅ JSDoc documentation for components
- ✅ PropTypes validation for all components
- ✅ Component development checklist and workflow documentation

## Implementation Plan

We have created a comprehensive component-migration-plan.md that serves as our roadmap. It includes:

1. **Detailed Task Breakdown**: All remaining work organized by component with specific tasks
2. **Implementation Timeline**: Phased approach with clear deadlines
3. **Progress Tracking**: Weekly goals and review process
4. **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and accessibility testing for each component
5. **Documentation Requirements**: JSDoc, Storybook, and usage examples

## Current Phase (Phase 1: 2 Weeks)

We are currently in Phase 1 of the implementation plan, focusing on:

1. **Finishing Projects Section**: (~65% complete)
   - Enhancing ProjectsCard and Projects container
   - Adding appropriate test coverage
   - Refining responsive design and animations
   - Documentation and Storybook updates

2. **Experience and Skills Sections**: (~40-45% complete)
   - Implementing Storybook designs in actual components
   - Enhancing data hooks with validation and memoization
   - Creating appropriate test coverage
   - Documentation updates

3. **Technical Debt Reduction**:
   - Moving CSS to component-specific files
   - Consistently applying design tokens
   - Adding test coverage for refactored components

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Technical Debt
- CSS organization: Moving from section-based to component-based
- Test coverage: Many components lack comprehensive tests
- Component consistency: Need to align with atomic design patterns

### Next Steps (2-Week Sprint)
- Complete Projects section refactoring with proper animation optimizations
- Advance Experience section to at least 70% completion
- Advance Skills section to at least 70% completion
- Increase test coverage for all refactored components
- Update Storybook documentation to reflect implementation changes

This progress document will be updated as we complete phases in our component-migration-plan.md.
