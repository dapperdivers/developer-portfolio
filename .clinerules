# Project Intelligence & Usage Patterns

This document serves as a reference guide to the AI context documentation for the Developer Portfolio project. For detailed guidelines, please refer to the structured documentation in the `ai-context/` directory.

## Development Server

- The development server is running at http://localhost:3001
- Do not attempt to start the development server as it is already running

## AI Context Documentation Structure

The project guidelines and best practices are organized in the following structure:

## Key Guidelines Summary

### Component Organization (Atomic Design)
- Atoms: Basic building blocks (`src/components/atoms/`)
- Molecules: Groups of atoms (`src/components/molecules/`)
- Organisms: Complex UI components (`src/components/organisms/`)
- Layout components: Structural components (`src/components/layout/`)
- Container components: Page sections (`src/containers/`)
- Each component has a paired CSS file with the same name
- Component tests go in `__tests__` directories adjacent to components
- Feature-specific hooks live in `src/hooks/`
- Context providers live in `src/context/`

For details, see: `ai-context/component/organization.md`

### Naming Conventions
- PascalCase for component files and component names
- camelCase for utility functions and hooks
- Hooks start with `use` prefix (e.g., `useProjects.js`)
- CSS files match component names exactly
- Test files use `.test.jsx` extension
- Enhanced tests use `.enhanced.test.jsx` extension

For details, see: `ai-context/component/naming.md`

### Design System Approach
- Use CSS variables (custom properties) for design tokens
- Design tokens are defined in `src/assets/css/design-system/`
- Component-specific styles in dedicated CSS files
- Follow BEM naming convention for CSS classes
- Use CSS Modules for component-scoped styles

For details, see: `ai-context/design-system/tokens.md` and `ai-context/design-system/css.md`

### Testing Strategy
- Unit Tests: Component-level in `__tests__/` directories
- Integration Tests: Component interactions
- Enhanced Tests: Animations and accessibility with `.enhanced.test.jsx`
- E2E Tests: Full user flows in `e2e/` directory

For details, see: `ai-context/testing/strategy.md`

### Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Apply useCallback for event handlers passed as props
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- Implement proper key props for list items
- Use intersection observer for lazy loading and animations

For details, see: `ai-context/performance/optimization.md`

### Modern Development Practices
- TypeScript for type safety
- CSS Modules for component styling
- Storybook for component development
- Automated accessibility testing
- Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality

For details, see: `ai-context/development/practices.md`

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Adding a New Section
1. Create a new container component in `src/containers/`
2. Use the Section layout component as a wrapper
3. Create feature-specific components in appropriate atomic level directories
4. Create a feature-specific custom hook in `src/hooks/`
5. Add data to the portfolio context
6. Import and add to App.jsx (consider using React.lazy)
7. Create section-specific CSS using design tokens

For details, see: `ai-context/component/implementation.md`

### Component Migration Pattern
1. Identify common patterns in existing component
2. Extract these patterns to base UI components
3. Create appropriate component hierarchy
4. Add prop validation and documentation
5. Implement feature-specific custom hooks for logic
6. Apply context for data access
7. Apply performance optimizations
8. Update CSS to use design tokens
9. Add necessary tests

For details, see: `ai-context/component/migration.md`

## Implementation Approach

### Incremental Migration Strategy
1. Start with project structure and design token system
2. Create base atomic components (atoms)
3. Implement context API for state management
4. Refactor one section at a time
   - Start with Projects section
   - Then Experience, Skills, Education, and other sections
5. Apply performance optimizations
6. Improve accessibility
7. Add tests and documentation

For details, see: `ai-context/README.md`

## User Preferences

### Implementation Focus
- Prefer atomic, reusable components over one-off solutions
- Focus on maintainable code with clear documentation
- Prioritize accessibility and performance
- Follow the implementation steps checklist in docs
- Use component migration examples as reference
- Implement design system tokens consistently

For details, see: `ai-context/README.md`
